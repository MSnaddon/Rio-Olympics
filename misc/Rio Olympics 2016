Rio Olympics 2016

Itâ€™s the Olympic Games in Rio! The organising body want you to help them out with an important feature for their website. They are looking for an app that will track the Nations, Athletes and results of Events.

They would like to make it possible to add an Athlete, which will have an associated Nation. Event results should keep track of the athlete who got gold, silver and bronze as well as the event they participated in.

They would ideally like:

Nation medal results table with
gold, silver and bronze count for each nation
total points for each nation based on:
5 for Gold
3 for Silver
1 for Bronze
Be able to add an Athlete, Nation and Event result.
